    <h1>Roberto</h1>

    <p>Roberto, originally from Laredo, Texas, attended the University of Texas in Austin where he completed his B.F.A. in Studio Fine Arts. Roberto mentored under Professor Charles Umlauf, and the two kept a close relationship until the latter's death.

    <p>In 1997, Roberto moved to Pagosa Springs, Colorado where he and his wife, Ana, built their second home and foundry. Still residing in Pagosa Springs, Roberto is engaged as a full-time sculptor and painter.</p>

    <p>He believes strongly that the best of art comes from a person's soul and imagination. To him, art is a discipline that requires practice, dedication, and patience in order to become skilled. Roberto believes in creating art for the sake of art, and as a form of expression that fulfills the creative desire unique and present in every individual. Every new work is a lesson and a step towards creating the next one. All of Roberto's work is done by the artist himself, including all apects of bronze casting.</p>
